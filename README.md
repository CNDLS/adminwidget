# Admins - A WordPress widget
Provides a widget that lists the administrators/instructors in a WordPress site.

From the Dashboard, find the left side menu, and click "Plugins". This will take you to a list of all available plugins. Find the widget called "Authors" and click "Activate."

Now, return to the left sidebar menu and click "Appearances," then "Widgets." On this page, the main "Available Widgets" menu should now display the "Admins" widget. Drag the "Authors" widget over to the right Sidebar. Name the widget "Admins" (or your relevant name of choice), then click "Save." Registered blog authors will now appear in the sidebar on the public view of the blog.
